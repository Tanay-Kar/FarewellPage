                    <p>Deblina Ma'am had an amazing teaching capability. She had the unspoken
                        skill to explain the most complex of topics in the most lucid manner. She
                        never believed in a locked classroom and rather explained the topics in ways
                        that we could relate to in class. Having her as our teacher was a blessing.

                    <h3 class="h2">Understanding</h3>
                    <p>We were blessed with a teacher on whom we could depend. She
                        was not only a class teacher but also a friend, a mentor, an altruist,
                        a supporter and a guide. She was always there for us and we could always
                        count on her. She was the one who understood us the most and was the guiding
                        light in all of a our endevours.

                        tree whose huge branches provided a shelter and comfort to us all. She was also
                        a sun radiating the warmth and light of knowledge to us all. <b>She was and will always

Her very personality, interactions and even scoldings were a lot different than any other teacher of my life, and even though this news of her departure pains me, I will try to smile and will always strive to get better so that I can be someone whom she can be proud of, For Deblina Ma'am was not a teacher I deserved but was still Given to by GOD.</p>

                        <p>First, before starting anything, I just want to say that I am very bad at expressing myself whether it is something wrong or good, so here it goes... Maine sabse pehle ma'am ko mere liye concern dekha jab class 9 me mere pair (leg) ke upar se ek auto gaya tha...and tab jab maine ma'am me wo concern dekha, I saw a glimpse of my mom. ..u still remember when we were studying a lost child and ma'am was giving a brief description of a fair...I was constantly saying that 'kyu jala rhe ho ma'am mai aj tak nhi gya, so ma'am in return she said 'If anyone here will ever go to a fair make sure to invite him' that was soo sweet. Even in recent times after every period of deblina ma'am Soumya and I used to say that ek deblina ma'am ka hi period hai jo accha lagta hai and after the excursion too I got scolded by everyone except her, she was the one who explained me. Wo bas ek teacher nhi thi Jo ...my vocabulary is too small I can't express more.  </p>

                            Thank you for being a mother, a coach and a queen and shaping your children, players and soldiers. Surely the wisdom and love you have passed on to us will leave a lasting impression. Our best wishes will forever be with you whereever you may go.
